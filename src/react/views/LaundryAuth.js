/* TODO
  This page should allow authentication and linking against a Laundry.
  Login is trivial, so is sign up with social media. What we need to solve is:

   * Sign-up with username/password
   * Reset password

  Both cases are critical because people may sign-up addresses which they do not own
  if they gain access to the invite code
